# Week-21-Deep-Learning-Challenge

## Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received access to a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns

APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type

AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry

CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification

USE_CASE—Use case for funding

ORGANIZATION—Organization type

STATUS—Active status

INCOME_AMT—Income classification

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application

ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested

IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively


## Instructions
### Step 1: Preprocess the Data
Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), you’ll need to preprocess the dataset. This step prepares you for Step 2, where you'll compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

Start by uploading the starter file to Google Colab, then using the information we provided in the Challenge files, follow the instructions to complete the preprocessing steps.

From the provided cloud URL, read in the charity_data.csv to a Pandas DataFrame, and be sure to identify the following in your dataset:

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the feature(s) for your model?
Drop the EIN and NAME columns.

Determine the number of unique values for each column.

For columns that have more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value.

Use the number of data points for each unique value to pick a cutoff point to combine "rare" categorical variables together in a new value, Other, and then check if the replacement was successful.

Use pd.get_dummies() to encode categorical variables.

Split the preprocessed data into a features array, X, and a target array, y. Use these arrays and the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing datasets.

Scale the training and testing features datasets by creating a StandardScaler instance, fitting it to the training data, then using the transform function.

### Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

Continue using the file in Google Colab in which you performed the preprocessing steps from Step 1.

Create a neural network model by assigning the number of input features and nodes for each layer using TensorFlow and Keras.

Create the first hidden layer and choose an appropriate activation function.

If necessary, add a second hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.

Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.

Check the structure of the model.

Compile and train the model.

Create a callback that saves the model's weights every five epochs.

Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy.

Save and export your results to an HDF5 file. Name the file AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.

### Step 3: Optimize the Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize your model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

Use any or all of the following methods to optimize your model:

Adjust the input data to ensure that no variables or outliers are causing confusion in the model, such as:
Dropping more or fewer columns.
Creating more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
Add more neurons to a hidden layer.
Add more hidden layers.
Use different activation functions for the hidden layers.
Add or reduce the number of epochs to the training regimen.
Note: If you make at least three attempts at optimizing your model, you will not lose points if your model does not achieve target performance.

Create a new Google Colab file and name it AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb.

Import your dependencies and read in the charity_data.csv to a Pandas DataFrame from the provided cloud URL.

Preprocess the dataset as you did in Step 1. Be sure to adjust for any modifications that came out of optimizing the model.

Design a neural network model, and be sure to adjust for modifications that will optimize the model to achieve higher than 75% accuracy.

Save and export your results to an HDF5 file. Name the file AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5.

### Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
For this part of the assignment, you’ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: This analysis is to explain the model that created an algorithm to help Alphabet Soup predict if applicants for funding will be successful or unsuccessful. This binary classifier model was able to predict with a moderately high degree of accuracy if the funding will be successful or not.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?  The Is_Successful column was used.

- What variable(s) are the features for your model? There are the features of this model:
    - NAME
    - APPLICATION_TYPE
    - AFFILIATION
    - CLASSIFICATION
    - USE_CASE
    - ORGANIZATION
    - STATUS
    - INCOME_AMT
    - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
    - ASK_AMT

- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? The column EIN was removed as it is an identifier and there is no impact to the data.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? The second Optimized model used 3 hidden layers each with multiple neurons which increased the accuracy from .7286 to .7804. The Initial model had only 2 layers. The epochs decreased from 100 to 50 in the second optimized model.

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance? Yes the optimized model surpassed the 75% target with a 78% outcome.

- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance? The NAME column was binned to keep names that occurred at least 10 times. The hidden nodes were increased and a third hidden layer was also added. The number of epochs was decreased to 50, rather than 100.

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.

  Overall, by optimizing the model we are able to increase the accuracy to above 78%. This means we are able to correctly classify each of the points in the test data 78% of the time, which surpassed the 75% target. This means an applicant has a 78% chance of being successful if they have the following:

- The NAME of the applicant appears more than 10 times.
- The CLASSIFICATION for the application is either: C1000, C1200, C2000, C2100 or C3000.

Alternative Model:
Random Forest algorithm could be an alternative model for this data. The finance industry often uses this model. The model can be easily scaled to large datasets, can be good at not overfitting, and is resilient to noisy data. The random forest model works by creating random predictions from decision trees and creates an average of these results to build a model.
